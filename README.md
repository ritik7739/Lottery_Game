# Lottery Game

Welcome to the **Lottery Game** project! This guide will help you set up the project on your local machine so you can start developing and playing the game.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js**: You can download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: This typically comes with Node.js. Verify the installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal.

### Steps to Install

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, you need to clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ritik7739/lottery-game.git
    ```

    Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username or the appropriate username where the repository is hosted.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Change your current directory to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd lottery-game
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    Install all the required npm packages by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will download and install all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the Development Server**

    After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will launch the application, and you can view it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Additional Commands

Here are a few additional npm scripts you might find useful:

- **Build the Project**

    To create an optimized production build of your project, run:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

- **Preview the Production Build**

    After building the project, you can preview it using:

    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```

    This will serve the built project locally so you can ensure everything is working as expected.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation or while running the project, consider the following steps:

- Ensure all prerequisites are installed correctly.
- Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
- Check for any errors in the terminal and consult the project's documentation or open an issue on GitHub for further assistance.

## Conclusion

You should now have the Lottery Game project up and running on your local machine. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.

Enjoy developing and playing the Lottery Game! ðŸŽ‰
